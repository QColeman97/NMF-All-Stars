Week 8:
- Begining preproccessing of data 

- Converting numeric strings to respective floats or integers
- Filling missing data in a meaningful way
- Conversion of catagorical data to quantitative values
* Concerned about how much matrix grows when using get dummies to convert data
* Concerned about reversing the catagorical to quantitative proccess
* Unsure if all coumns are really meaningful e.g. name


Week 9:
- Comleted preprocessing of a real world dataset
- Will begin creating a synthetic dataset for testing

    Want poor classifiers to perform poorly on this dataset, but good classifiers (like NMF) to perform well
- Experimenting with poor classifiers: logistic regressions and linear regression and good classifiers: NMF and random forest
- Synthetic data will need:

    a lot of features: many unimportant features and only a few important features
    
    way more dimensions than samples
