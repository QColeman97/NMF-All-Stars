## Project Log 1
### Week 8

#### Wed -> Group Meeting @ Library 
    - Discussed how to use NMF for dimensionality reduction. 
    - How we should measure performance. Comparing to PCA?
#### Thur -> Lab Meeting @ 466 Lab
    - Wrote pseudocode for comparing NMF to PCA by calculating pearson correlation values for basis vectors
    - Wrote pseudocode for recusrively reducing dimensions using NMF by aproximating a new V with (W)(H)=new_V
    - Discussed methodology for comparing pca and nmf for clustering
#### Sun -> Individual Work @ Home
    - Implemented previous written psuedocode for comparing NMF to PCA and recursively reducing dimensions with NMF.

### Week 9

#### Mon -> Group Meeting @ Library
    - Was able to merge key functions from respective group members code which allowed me to debug my previously written soluions with our new model for NMF
    - Discussed pre proccessing our dataset
